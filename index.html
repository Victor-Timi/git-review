<!-- Working directory branch -->

<!-- 
When you type `git checkout -b "branch name"`
What you are saying is:
Git create a new branch named "branch name"
And move my working directory to the branch named "branch name"

If this branch already exists, it is going to say `fatal: a branch named "branch name" already exists`

If you wanna create a new branch named "branch name":
`git branch "branch name"`

If you want to move your working directory to the branch named "branch name"
`git checkout "branch name"`

 -->
